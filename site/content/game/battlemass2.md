Battlemass is a turn-based strategy game where matches are played on a map consisting of tiles, and in turns of 3 phases â€“ combat, harvest and build. The goal is to destroy your opponent's Main Building. You will mine the map's tiles, causing them to lower and altering the possible tiles that units can move to and attack from.
