In this game you will harvest Slime Monster eggs from Slime Vents to deposit into the Mana pit. The Mana pit will extract concentrated Mana from the eggs and send it to the Alchemists.

The Alchemists will reward you with currency which can be spend at the shop to buy equipment which will help automate the harvesting and delivery process and even to combine eggs into new types.

Find a way to open the stone doors and explore deeper into the dungeon.
