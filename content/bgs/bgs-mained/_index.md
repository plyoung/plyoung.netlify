The main editor is where most settings and data is defined. Plug-ins will add their own tabs to this editor where data need to be defined for those plug-ins. Please refer to documentation of the plug-in for information about its main editor settings where applicable. This section will only cover the settings and data requirements of the BGS core system.

The main editor can be opened via `menu: BGS > BGS Main Editor`.
